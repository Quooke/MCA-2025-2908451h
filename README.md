<h1 id="week-1-musical-datasets">Week 1: Musical Datasets</h1>

<h2 id="task-1-dataset-theme">Task 1: Dataset theme</h2>

<p>The theme of my dataset is the American blues rock band The Black Keys. The band consists of two members, a guitarist and lead vocalist Dan Auerbach and a drummer Patric Carney. The duo formed the bend in Akron, Ohio in 2001 and has since released nine albums for which it won numerous awards, including six Grammy awards. To this day, they have five number one hits to their name, including Tighten Up, Gold on the Ceiling and Lonely Boy. Their latest album, Let’s Rock, was released mid 2019 after a five year break. 
I chose them as my dataset theme because I am a big fan of the band and their work, so I am quite familiar with their music, which I believe will help me complete the further tasks better.</p>

<h2 id="task-2-current-manifestations-of-data-relating-to-my-dataset">Task 2: Current manifestations of data relating to my dataset</h2>

<h3 id="descriptive-data">Descriptive data</h3>

<p>On the band’s official website under ‘Shop’, which is not the most intuitive place on the website to look for this information, one can find a lot of descriptive data about each of their nine so far released albums. This data includes all the musicians who worked on the albums’ creation, together with their particular roles in the process, production credits and so on. Their music is available on all big music streaming services including Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer where it is normally organised into albums, often into “essentials” playlists which consist of their most listened tracks, can be added to the user-made playlists etc. Moreover, these services have the capability to make recommendations of “new music” or “you may also like” music to its users which they do with The Black Keys’ music too. All of this is possible due to the descriptive data they have stored in the background based on which they can categorise, organise, compare and recommend their songs. However, this data is not visible to the users of those platforms. Visible data, specifically on Apple Music includes the song name, artist, album name, duration of the song, composers, genre, year, track number, play count, user’s rating, album/single artwork, lyricists, copyright information, file information (type, size, bitrate, history).</p>

<h3 id="notated-data">Notated data</h3>

<p>When it comes to notated music, it is possible to find sheet music for most of their songs on numerous online digital sheet music catalogues such as musicnotes.com which is the biggest of its kind. Apart from offering notated music, it allows the users to filter the files by title, artist, album and scoring as well as chose the preferred instruments.</p>

<h3 id="acoustic-data">Acoustic data</h3>

<p>As already mentioned, acoustic data can be found on all major streaming services as well as YouTube where it is published both on the band’s official channel and on other channels as live concerts, lyrics videos, fan covers etc.</p>
