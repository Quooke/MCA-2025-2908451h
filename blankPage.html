    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <p> The song I decided to choose is gymnopedie due to the fact it is in the public domain. My theme is music based on festivals. Gynopedie is based on a annual greek festival.Although I’m not proficient in music,
      I do know how to play this song on the piano. 
      Because of its familiarity, I believe that I will understand if there are any mistakes when transforming this music.
