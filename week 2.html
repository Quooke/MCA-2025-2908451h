    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <p> Using the musescore website was a little confusing as it was unclear on which sheet music is copyright free.
      Luckily due to my song being over hundred years old it's in the public domain.
      What can be time consuming is making the account and we had some difficulties downloading the file from the website.
      The musescore application is quite overwhelming for someone who hasn't used it before, however after a little while I could learn some of the tools and move some notes around to edit the piece
